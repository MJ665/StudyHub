        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          StudyBuddy collects the information you provide to use the platform: your name and work
          email (for authentication), your organization/role, and the content you generate —
          assessment attempts and scores, discussion posts, and any documents you upload to the
          Knowledge Transfer (KT) module. We also collect basic usage and device information
          (including a push-notification token if you use the mobile app) to operate the service.

        <h2>2. How We Use It</h2>
        <p>
          Your data is used to provide the assessment and knowledge-transfer features, generate
          AI feedback and analytics for you and your organization&apos;s administrators, and send
          you relevant notifications. We do not sell your personal data.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Data Sharing &amp; Processors</h2>
        <p>
          Content is visible within your organization according to your role. We use trusted
          processors to operate the service (cloud hosting, an AI model provider for evaluations
          and embeddings, email delivery, and — for the mobile app — a push-notification
          provider). These process data only to deliver the service.

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>
          Data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS). Passwords are hashed. Access to organization data
          is scoped by role and organization membership.

        <h2>5. Your Rights &amp; Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete your account and associated personal data at any time from the app:
          open <strong>My Profile → Security → Delete account</strong>. Deleting your account
          deactivates it and removes your personal identifiers (name and email are anonymized and
          your credentials are erased). To request deletion by email instead, contact your
          organization administrator or{' '}
          <a href="mailto:contact.hackathonmj@gmail.com">contact.hackathonmj@gmail.com</a>. We
          process deletion requests within 30 days.
